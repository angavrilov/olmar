readme.txt for Elkhound/Elsa distribution
-----------------------------------------

This release is provided under the BSD license.  See license.txt.

Elkhound is a parser generator.  See additional documentation
in elkhound/readme.txt.  

Elsa is a C/C++ parser that uses Elkhound.  Elsa doesn't have
much documentation yet.


Build instructions:

  $ ./configure 
  $ make
  $ make check     (optional but a good idea)
  

I need to put more here... (duh)

If you run into problems you can email me: smcpeak@cs.berkeley.edu
But be aware I'm usually pretty busy so responses may take a couple
of days.

readme.txt for Elkhound/Elsa distribution
-----------------------------------------

This release is provided under the BSD license.  See license.txt.

Elkhound is a parser generator.  
Elsa is a C/C++ parser that uses Elkhound.

See additional documentation in index.html in the various 
subdirectories.  You'll need to say "make doc" (after ./configure)
for some of the links to work.

Alternatively, see the Documentation section of
http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~smcpeak/elkhound/ .


Build instructions:

  $ ./configure 
  $ make
  $ make check     (optional but a good idea)
  

If you run into problems you can email me: smcpeak@cs.berkeley.edu
But be aware I'm usually pretty busy so responses may take a couple
of days.

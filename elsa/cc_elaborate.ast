  // that is not a subexpression of another expression.  If a language
  // construct is defined to produce an implicit call of a function, a
  // use of the language construct is considered to be an expression
  // for the purposes of this definition.

  // [Note: certain contexts in C++ cause the evaluation of a
  // full-expression that results from a syntactic construct other
  // than expression (5.18).  For example, in 8.5, another syntax for
  // initializer is '( expression-list )' but the resulting construct
  // is a function call upon a constructor function with
  // expression-list as an argument list; such a function call is a
  // full-expression.  For example, in 8.5, another syntax for
  // initializer is '= initializer-clause' but again the resulting
  // construct might be a function call upon a constructor function
  // with one assignment-expression as an argument; again, the
  // function call is a full-expression. ]

  // FullExpressions because the whole of Initializer is.  I think the
  // FullExpressionAnnot is redundant in the case of IN_compound, but
  // I like sharing it in Initializer and an extra layer doesn't hurt.

  // TODO: sm: Currently, we associate a FullExpressionAnnot with
  // Initializer, which means we get one for every element of a
  // compound initializer.  This wastes a lot of space, and doesn't
  // make sense for IN_compound.  I think we should say that (only)
  // the entire initializer is a single Full Expression, but that
  // requires adding another layer, like:
  //
  //   Initializer                   // has FullExpressionAnnot
  //     -> IN_cinit(CInitializer)
  //     -> IN_ctor(..)
  //   CInitializer                  // "C" for compound
  //     -> CI_expr
  //     -> CI_compound(..)
  //

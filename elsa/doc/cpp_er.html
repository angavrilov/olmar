<p>
This page contains data model diagrams useful for understanding the
C++ language.  They show the various concepts in C++ static
(compile-time) semantics, and their interrelationships. 

<p>
One use of these data models is to help understand the C++ Standard
document.  It collects together the essential notions in the language,
what components they have, how they are related, etc.  The data model
is intended to be sufficiently complete that it could serve as the
basis for a formal definition of the static semantics.

<p>
Another use is to understand the Elsa implementation.  Not surprisingly,
many concepts in the data models correspond to prominent classes in
the Elsa implementation.  However, the correspondence is not exact;
in some cases, there are deviations due to known bugs in Elsa, while in
others Elsa simply uses an implementation technique that may obscure
a given concept.  Nevertheless, the intent is that Elsa should use a
data model that could (in principle) be mapped back and forth to the
model presented here.

<p>
That the names used in these diagrams do not correspond exactly with
either the terminology in the standard (which is often unnecessarily
vague) nor that used in Elsa (which makes fewer distinctions, for
example among kinds of Variables).  However, there is an overall
attempt at terminological consistency.


<h1>Notation</h1>

<p>
The following diagrams use a notation that it is a mixture of
traditional Entity-Relationship diagrams and UML, with some of my
own ideas thrown in:
<ul>

<li>Entities are shown in boxes.  A dashed box indicates an entity that
    with attributes and/or relationships that are elided from the
    diagram.

<li>Attributes are in ellipses.  Dashed ellipses similarly indicate
    elided detail.

<li>Relationships are thin lines with arrowheads connecting entities.
    Either or both ends of a relationship may be named; the opposite
    end of a named end has an arrowhead.  When an endpoint is named,
    an annotation on the name indicates a <em>cardinality</em>, which
    is the number times that a single instance of the entity may
    participate in the relationship:
    <ul>
    <li>Name with no annotation: cardinality is one.
    <li>Name with "?" annotation: zero or one.
    <li>Name with "*" annotation: any number, including zero.
    <li>Name with "[]" annotation: relation tuples are <em>ordered</em>,
        forming a <em>sequence</em>; cardinality is anything.
    <li>Unnamed: cardinality is anything.
    </ul>

<li>Attributes can be given "?", "*" and "[]" annotations, with similar
    meanings as for relationships.  In fact, attribute notation is used
    interchangeably with relationship notation where convenient.

<li>Specialization (often conceptualized as inheritance) is indicated
    by thick lines connecting entities, with triangular split points.
    A solid triangle indicates <em>total</em> specialization (meaning
    the superclass is abstract) while an open triangle indicates
    <em>partial</em> specialization.  Color is used to emphasize
    important specialization hierarchies.
    <ul>
    <li>What is the difference between a partial specialization and
        an optional ("?") attribute or relationship?  The former cannot
        change during the entity's lifetime, while the latter can.
    </ul>
</ul>


<h1>Diagram 1: Scopes, Variables and Types</h1>

<p>
The following diagram
(xfig sources: <a href="er.fig">er.fig</a>,
postscript: <a href="er.ps">er.ps</a>)
shows the essential static semantic concepts, such as scopes,
variables and types.  It omits templates, and it omits executable
AST fragments like statements and expressions.

<p>
<center><img src="er.png" alt="C++ Static Semantics ER diagram"></center>

<p>
This diagram has four primary dimensions:
<ul>
<li>Scope (green): Places searched during lookup.
<li>Variable (blue): Things found by lookup.
<li>Type (red): Types built up from type constructors.
<li>AtomicType (magenta): Fundamental units of type identity.
</ul>

<h2>Name</h2>

<p>
Names [3p4] denote Variables.  As explained in [3p7], there are three
kinds of Names: identifiers, operators, and conversions.  Names are
<em>extensional</em>: two Names are the same if they have the same
attributes and named relationships, and they are immutable once
created.

<h3>Identifier</h3>

<p>
An Identifier is a Name consisting of a nonempty sequence of source
characters.

<h3>OperatorName</h3>

<p>
An OperatorName is a Name consisting of the keyword <tt>operator</tt>
followed by one of the overloadable operators [13.5p1].

<h3>ConversionName</h3>

<p>
A ConversionName is a Name consisting of the keyword <tt>operator</tt>
followed by a Type [12.3.2].

<h2>Scope</h2>

<p>
A Scope ("declarative region") [3.3] is a set of Variables.  Name
lookup [3.4] searches for a Name amongst a certain sequence of Scopes,
yielding the set of Variables that have the given Name.  There are
rules [3.3p4] that restrict the set of Variables that may have the
same Name and Scope; the data model itself does not enforce them.

<p>
The Standard's notion of the "potential scope of a variable" is
induced by the timing of the sequence of updates to Scopes
corresponding to processing declarations.  I have chosen not to
include an explicit notion of time or point of declaration in this
data model, but I may reconsider.

<p>
(Currently missing from data model: function scopes, which contain
the labels for <tt>goto</tt> statements.)

<h3>Namespace</h3>

<p>
A Namespace [3.3.5, 7.3] is a scope outside any class or function.
They include the GlobalScope.  Namespaces can be connected by
UsingDirectives [7.3.4].

<h3>BlockScope</h3>

<p>
A BlockScope ("local scope") [3.3.2] contains local variables in
a function.  FunctionDefinitions include a BlockScope that spans
their body.

<h3>PrototypeScope</h3>

<p>
A PrototypeScope [3.3.3] contains the parameters of a function
declarator that is not the declarator of a function definition.

<h3>ClassType (as a Scope)</h3>

<p>
A ClassType [9] includes the scope [3.3.6] that contains the
class members.  It is described further in another entry below.


<h2>Variable</h2>

<p>
A Variable (a mixture of Standard concepts "entity" [3p3] and
"declaration" [3p5]) is something that can be found by lookup.  Every
Variable is a member of exactly one Scope.

<p>
A Variable's name is both optional and mutable.  It is optional
because function and template parameters may be declared without names
[8.3.5p8, 14.1p1].  It is mutable because subsequent declarations may
add or change a name.  Variables without names are not subject to the
rules of [3.3p4] that restrict same-named Variables in a Scope.

<h3>NamespaceAlias</h3>

<p>
A NamespaceAlias [7.3.2] provides an alternate name for a Namespace.

<h3>Function</h3>

<p>
A Function (Variable) is a unique name for a FunctionDefinition,
which is a fragment of executable AST.  A Function may or may not
have a definition, and that aspect may change during processing of
a translation unit.

<h3>Enumerator</h3>

<p>
An Enumerator [7.2] is one of the elements of an Enumeration.

<h3>UsingAlias</h3>

<p>
A UsingAlias is introduced by a using-declaration [7.3.3].  When a
lookup finds a UsingAlias, it transparently follows the "target"
field.

<h3>DataVariable</h3>

<p>
A DataVariable denotes a piece of named run-time data.  It
can have any type other than a FunctionType (or <tt>void</tt>).
DataVariables are partitioned:
<ul>
<li>LocalVariable: Appears in a BlockScope, denotes a variable
    local to a function.  LocalVariables may have an initializer
    Expression; this is relevant to static semantics only if
    the variable is also <tt>const</tt> [5.19].
<li>GlobalVariable: Appears in a Namespace, denotes a variable
    visible to all functions (modulo namespace visibility).
<li>FunctionParameter: Appears in a BlockScope (for FunctionDefinitions) or
    a PrototypeScope, denotes a function parameter.
    (TODO: Hmmm.  How are ProtoypeScopes related
    to FunctionTypes and FunctionDefinitions?)       
    A FunctionParameter may have a default value expression [8.3.6].
<li>DataMember: Appears in a ClassType scope, denotes a data member
    of a class (or struct or union).  These are further subdivided
    into static and nonstatic members, the former of which may have
    an initializer.
<li>HandlerParam: Appears in a BlockScope, denotes the variable
    bound to an exception object in an exception handler [15.3].
</ul>

<h2>ClassMember</h2>

<p>
A ClassMember is any Variable other than an Enumerator that is a
member of a ClassType Scope.  Such Variables have an "access"
attribute that is <tt>public</tt>, <tt>protected</tt> or
<tt>private</tt>.  The access attribute of an Enumerator in
a ClassType Scope can be determined by examining its type.

<h3>ImplicitlyDeclaredMemberFunction</h3>

<p>
An ImplicitlyDeclaredMemberFunction is a constructor, destructor
or copy assignment operator that is implicitly declared [12p1].


<h2>TypeName</h2>

<p>
A TypeName names a type for purposes of lookup.  

<h3>Typedef</h3>

<p>
A Typedef [7.1.3] is a type name in a scope, introduced via
the <tt>typedef</tt> keyword.

<h3>InjectedClassName</h3>

<p>
An InjectedClassName [9p2] is an alias for a ClassType within the
scope of that ClassType.

<h3>NamedAtomicType</h3>

<p>
A NamedAtomicType is both a TypeName and an AtomicType.  That is,
it can be found by lookup, and it can be used to form constructed
("compound") types and be cv-qualified.

<h3>ClassType</h3>

<p>
A ClassType is a <tt>class</tt> or <tt>struct</tt> or <tt>union</tt>;
the "keyword" field distinguishes these.  It has a sequence of base
classes, each of which has an "access" specifier and may be virtual.
It may also have a ClassDefinition, which is an AST fragment.  The
presence of a ClassDefinition distinguishes forward declarations
[3.4.4, 7.1.5.3, 9.2p2], and is also useful for implementing templates.

<p>
A ClassType has a set of constructors and a destructor.  They are
found by direct examination of the ClassType, not by lookup, because
they do not have names [12.1p1, 12.4(?)].  The data model allows both
to be missing to accomodate the analysis of the class itself, which
does not know in advance how to make them.

<p>
Currently, ClassType is called "CompoundType" in Elsa.

<h3>Enumeration</h3>

<p>
An Enumeration [7.2] is a type consisting of a set of named constants,
called enumerators.

<h2>Type</h2>

<p>
A Type [3.9, 8.3] is an entity or concept that is used within the
static semantics to approximate the dynamic semantics.  In the
data model here, "Type" denotes those types constructed by applying
type constructors and/or cv-qualifiers [3.9.2, 8.3] to other Types or
AtomicTypes.  Types are extensional: two Types are equivalent if they
have the same structure (attributes and relationships), and they
are immutable once created.

<h3>FunctionType</h3>

<p>
A FunctionType [8.3.5] is the type of a function.  It has a return
type, parameters, and an optional exception specification.  Parameter
types are equivalent if they have the same cv-unqualified type; that
is, the name and the top-level cv-qualification of parameter types are
not significant for type equivalence.

<p>
Even though the syntax of function declarators includes an exception
specification, such specifications are only allowed when part of the
certain declarations [15.4p1].

<h3>MethodType</h3>

<p>
The type of a nonstatic member function, what I call a method, is a
FunctionType that has a receiver parameter.  The receiver is always a
reference to a (possibly cv-qualified) class type; the
cv-qualification of the receiver records the cv-qualification of the
member function declarator [8.3.5p4].

<h3>DataType</h3>

<p>
An DataType is a Type that is not a FunctionType.  Note that the
related Standard term "object type" [3.9p9] does not include
references or <tt>void</tt>.

<h3>CVAtomicType</h3>

<p>
A CVAtomicType is a leaf in a Type tree.  It refers to an AtomicType,
and possibly cv-qualifies [3.9.3] it.

<h3>IndirectionType</h3>

<p>
IndirectionType is the common ancestor for the types that are 
constructed primarily from one other type.

<h3>PointerType</h3>

<p>
A PointerType [8.3.1] is the type of a pointer to some other type,
possibly with cv-qualification.  The cv-qualifiers apply to the
pointer itself, not the referent (the type pointed to).

<h3>PointerToMemberType</h3>

<p>
A PointerToMemberType [8.3.3] is the type of a pointer to a
nonstatic class member.  In addition to cv-qualifiers, it names
the class of which the referent is a member.

<h3>ReferenceType</h3>

<p>
A ReferenceType [8.3.2] is the type of a reference to some other
type.  It cannot be cv-qualified.

<h3>ArrayType</h3>

<p>
An ArrayType [8.3.4] is the type of an array.  It does not
(necessarily) have a known size.

<h3>SizedArrayType</h3>

<p>
A SizedArrayType is the type of an array with known size.

<h2>AtomicType</h2>

<p>
An AtomicType is a type which is not built from type constructors.
Their identity is <em>physical</em>, not structural: two AtomicTypes
can be different even when they have the same attributes and
relationships.

<h3>NamedAtomicType (as an AtomicType)</h3>

<p>
NamedAtomicType was already discussed above.  However, in this context
it is worth explaining that even though class types are in some sense
built by applying a "type constructor", this data model and the C++
language regard the <tt>class { ... }</tt> syntax as creating a new type, 
<em>not</em> equivalent to another type built with the same syntax.

<h3>FundamentalType</h3>

<p>
A FundamentalType [3.9.1] is one of the following:
<ul>
<li><tt>char</tt>
<li><tt>signed char</tt>
<li><tt>unsigned char</tt>
<li><tt>bool</tt>
<li><tt>signed int</tt>
<li><tt>unsigned int</tt>
<li><tt>signed long int</tt>
<li><tt>unsigned long int</tt>
<li><tt>signed short int</tt>
<li><tt>unsigned short int</tt>
<li><tt>wchar_t</tt>
<li><tt>float</tt>
<li><tt>double</tt>
<li><tt>long double</tt>
<li><tt>void</tt>
</ul>

<p>
Note that the data model does not imply any orthogonality between
modifiers like <tt>signed</tt> and "basic" types like <tt>int</tt>.

<p>
The FundamentalTypes are further subdivided into categories [3.9.1]
not reflected here.


<h1>Diagram 2: Templates</h1>

<p>
This diagram
(xfig sources: <a href="template_er.fig">template_er.fig</a>,
postscript: <a href="template_er.ps">template_er.ps</a>)
is an extension of the previous diagram, showing all the
new and extended concepts needed to represent templates.

<p>
<center><img src="template_er.png" alt="C++ Templates diagram"></center>

<p>
One point of terminology: whereas the Standard refers to "template
parameters" (etc.), I refer to "meta-parameters".  I use the term
"template" only for templates themselves, and use the prefix "meta-"
(or "Meta") for the parameters and values involved in defining and
using templates.

<p>
This diagram has five primary dimensions.  (They are all colored black because
assigning color seemed unnecessary, due to minimal overlap, and difficult
to keep compatible with the first diagram.)
<ul>
<li>MetaParameter vs. MetaValue: MetaParameters are holes, and MetaValues
    fill the holes.
<li>MetaParameter vs. MetaBinding: An unbound parameter is a hole, while
    a bound parameter represents a filled hole.
<li>Kinds of meta-entities: Meta-entities can be types or non-types, which
    further subdivide into ground types, templates, integers and (variable)
    names.  This axis is present only implicitly via products (see below).
<li>Template vs. Specialization: A template is an entity with holes.
    A specialization is a version of a template with the holes filled.
<li>Kinds of templates: There are three kinds of templates in C++: classes,
    functions and static data members.  This axis is only implicit.
</ul>

<p>
This diagram makes use of what I call <em>non-orthogonal inheritance
products</em>.  This means that a set of entities is derived by
multiplying two inheritance hierarchies together, but then giving
attributes and relationships to the product tuples independent of
their factors.  For example, an IntegerMetaParameter has an
"AtomicType", attribute/relationship, but this is not common to
MetaParameters nor IntegerMetaEntities.

<p>
Though non-orthogonal product tuples are individually named, their
derivation as product tuples is still available (though implicit), and
this is used to define the concept of <em>corresponding
relationships</em>, shown with dashed arrows.  For example, every
NameMetaParameter has an optional "val" relationship with a
NameMetaValue.  There are corresponding "val" relationships for the
other kinds of MetaValues.  These relationships are consistent with
respect to the meta-entity-kind axis, so it is well-defined to
introduce a "val" relationship between MetaParameters and MetaValues:
given a MetaParameter, find out which kind it is, and retrieve its
"val", which must be a MetaValue.  This makes it possible to
generically refer to the default value (when present) of a
MetaParameter as being a MetaValue, while at the same time having the
"val" relationships be well-typed w.r.t. the meta-entity-kind axis.  A
similar technique is used for the specializations/template
relationship.

<p>
The diagram has essentially two parts.  The central part, comprising
the five major dimensions above, is the data model required to
represent templates and specializations themselves.  Then, sprinkled
around the edges, is the second part which consists of miscellanous
extensions and refinements of Diagram 1 necessary to integrate template
concepts into the core data model.

<p>
Terminology:
<ul>
<li>"Abstract": an entity with unbound MetaParameters.
<li>"Concrete": an entity with no unbound MetaParameters.
    <br>
    Note: The Standard uses the terms "dependent" and "non-dependent"
    for these concepts, as in, "dependent upon template parameters"
    [14.6.2].  I find this terminology a bit unwieldy, and possibly
    confusing with the traditional concept of a "dependent type" in
    type theory, so I use abstract/concrete instead.
</ul>

<h2>MetaParameter</h2>

<p>
A MetaParameter is a parameter of a template [14.1].  By supplying a
MetaValue for the MetaParameter, the template can be instantiated
to produce a concrete entity.  Note that it is not a full
<em>meta-variable</em>; its value cannot be changed once set [14.1p6].

<p>
A MetaParameter has an optional default value.  As explained above,
the kind of MetaValue is dependent on the kind of MetaParameter,
according to a parallel decomposition of each along the
meta-entity-kind axis.

<h3>MetaBinding</h3>

<p>
A MetaParameter is a parameter, while a MetaBinding is a binding of a
MetaParameter to a MetaValue.  Unlike a MetaParameter, the "val"
relationship of a MetaBinding is not optional, because it carries the
binding.  Furthermore, the MetaValue to which it is bound must be
concrete; either a concrete Type, or one of the three
ConcreteMetaValues.  (Neither of these constraints is depicted
graphically.)

<h3>TypeNameMetaParameter</h3>

<p>
The type branch of the MetaParameter hierarchy [14.1p3] is represented
by the TypeNameMetaParameter.  It is a descendant of NamedAtomicType,
and as such can be looked up as a type, and used to build constructed
types.

<h3>TypeMetaParameter</h3>

<p>
A TypeMetaParameter, such as the ubiquitous "<tt>&lt;class
T&gt;</tt>", is a parameter that can be bound to concrete Type.
(Despite the idiomatic use of the <tt>class</tt> keyword to introduce
such parameters, they need not be bound to ClassTypes.)

<h3>TemplateMetaParameter</h3>

<p>
A TemplateMetaParameter is syntactically introduced with something like
<pre>
  template &lt;template &lt;class S&gt; class T&gt; /*...*/
</pre>
and known in the Standard as a "template template parameter".  It can
be bound to a ClassTemplate, enabling one template to use multiple
specializations of another (class) template.  

<p>
Note that it is not possible to pass a template function or a template
data member as the argument to a TemplateMetaParameter, though the
effect could be simulated by creating an appropriate wrapper
ClassTemplate.

<h3>NontypeMetaParameter</h3>

<p>
A NontypeMetaParameter is a descendant of Variable, and can be used
like an object variable.

<h3>IntegerMetaParameter</h3>

<p>
An IntegerMetaParameter may be bound to an integer value [14.3.2p1].
It has an AtomicType, but only integral types [3.9p7] and Enumerations
are permitted [14.1p4].  This data model does not record the
cv-qualification on the type of an IntegerMetaParameter because they
are irrelevant [14.1p5].

<h3>NameMetaParameter</h3>

<p>
A NameMetaParameter may be bound to a Function, GlobalVariable or
DataMember [14.3.2p1].  It has an IndirectionType, which must be
a PointerType, PointerToMemberType or ReferenceType [14.1p4].

<h2>MetaValue</h2>

<p>
A MetaValue is something that can fill a hole of a MetaParameter.
Syntactically, they are denoted with template arguments [14.3].
They are decomposed along the meta-entity-kind axis, just like
MetaParameters, though the diagram omits the names TypeNameMetaValue
and NontypeMetaValue for reasons of space.

<h3>TypeMetaValue</h3>

<p>
A TypeMetaValue is a Type.  It may be concrete or abstract, depending
on the Type.

<h3>TemplateMetaValue</h3>

<p>
A TemplateMetaValue is either a ConcreteTemplateMetaValue, which is
a specific ClassTemplate, or an AbstractTemplateMetaValue, which is
a reference to a TemplateMetaParameter.  AbstractTemplateMetaValues
only occur as the default values of TemplateMetaParameters.

<h3>IntegerMetaValue</h3>

<p>
An IntegerMetaValue is either a ConcreteIntegerMetaValue, which is
an integer, or an AbstractIntegerMetaValue, which is an Expression
that refers to MetaParameters.

<h3>NameMetaValue</h3>

<p>
A NameMetaValue is either a ConcreteNameMetaValue, which is a
specific concrete Variable, or is an AbstractNameMetaValue, which
is a reference to a NameMetaParameter.  AbstractNameMetaValues
only occur as the default values of NameMetaParameters.

<p>
The name of a template function may be passed as a syntactic template
argument, but overload resolution will select a specific
specialization for the binding [14.3.2p5b4,5].


<h2>Template</h2>

<p>
A Template is an entity with named holes (parameters) that can be
filled by supplying values.  Templates are distinct from (say)
ordinary parameterized functions in that template parameters are are
filled at compile time (only).

<p>
A Template is associated with a set of Specializations, instances
of that template.

<p>
Note that members of ClassTemplates are not necessarily called
Templates in this data model, even if they have holes due to the
parameters of the class.  Only member templates (where the
"<tt>template &lt;/*...*/&gt;</tt>" syntax is repeated inside the
class body) are both ClassMembers and Templates.

<p>
Note further, however, that currently (2005-08-19) Elsa takes
the opposite approach, regarding every member of a class template
as being a template in its own right.  I now regard this design
decision as a mistake, and hope to eventually rewrite that part
of Elsa using the data model shown here.

<h3>MetaParameterList</h3>

<p>
A Template is/has a MetaParameterList, a sequence of parameters.

<h2>Specialization</h2>

<p>
A Specialization is a Template with the holes filled with MetaValue
arguments.  The arguments are stored in a sequence that corresponds to
the parameter sequence.  Except in the case of a
ClassTemplatePartialSpecialization, a Specialization's arguments are
always concrete.

<p>
A Specialization may be either <em>implicit</em> or <em>explicit</em>.
An implicit specialization (also called an "instantiation") is
generated automatically by the compiler by filling the holes of the
Template definition with the supplied arguments.  An explicit
specialization is supplied by the programmer, and effectively overrides
implicit instantiation for a specific argument sequence.  

<p>
Note that the "explicit" attribute is a <em>mutable</em> boolean
field.  This is because it is possible for the program to refer to a
specialization prior to declaring it as an explicit specialization, as
long as the compiler has no need to implicitly instantiate it in the
meantime [14.7.3p6].  Thus, the static semantics and this data model
allow for a specialization to be initially assumed implicit, but later
determined to be explicit.


<h2>ClassTemplate</h2>

<p>
A ClassTemplate is a Template of a ClassType.  It also <em>is</em>
a ClassType: it can be looked up as a type (in which case template
arguments would then have to be supplied), has members, etc.

<h3>ClassTemplateSpecialization</h3>

<p>
A ClassTemplateSpecialization is a Specialization of a ClassTemplate.

<h3>ClassTemplatePartialSpecialization</h3>

<p>
A ClassTemplatePartialSpecialization [14.5.4] is a Specialization of
a ClassTemplate, whose template arguments ("args[]") are not all concrete.
The holes in its arguments are declared in its MetaParameterList; i.e.,
it is itself a ClassTemplate.


<h2>FunctionTemplate</h2>

<p>
A FunctionTemplate is a Template of a Function.

<h3>FunctionTemplateSpecialization</h3>

<p>
A FunctionTemplateSpecialization is a Specialization of a FunctionTemplate.

<p>
Note that, unlike for ClassTemplates, a Function cannot be both a
FunctionTemplate and a FunctionTemplateSpecialization (there is no
such thing as a function template partial specialization).


<h2>Abstract NamedAtomicTypes</h2>

<p>
Abstract types are supported by several extensions of NamedAtomicType.

<h3>TypeNameMetaParameter (as a NamedAtomicType)</h3>

<p>
Discussed above, a TypeNameMetaParameter is the leaf of any 
abstract type.  Note that a TypeNameMetaParameter need not be
abstract (it could be a TypeNameMetaBinding).

<h3>AbstractTemplateId</h3>

<p>
An AbstractTemplateId is a template-id (template name plus arguments)
where either the template or the arguments are abstract.  The template
is indicated as a NamedAtomicType, but it must always be either a
ClassTemplate or a TemplateMetaParameter.  For example:
<pre>
  template &lt;class T&gt;
  struct A;
  
  template &lt;class T&gt;
  struct B {
    A&lt;T&gt; a;
  };
</pre>
The B::a member has type <tt>A&lt;T&gt;</tt>, but (in the context of
the template B) <TT>T</TT> is abstract, so <tt>A&lt;T&gt;</tt> is too.

<p>
Here is an example with an abstract template portion of an AbstractTemplateId:
<pre>
  template &lt;template &lt;class S&gt; class T, class U&gt;
  struct A {
    T&lt;U&gt; t;
  };
</pre>
Here, A::t has type <tt>T&lt;U&gt;</tt>, in which both <TT>T</TT> and
<TT>U</TT> are abstract.

<p>
In Elsa, this is called a "PseudoInstantiation".

<h3>AbstractQualifiedType</h3>

<p>
An AbstractQualifiedType arises when a qualified name [3.4.3, 5.1p7]
is used, but the qualifier is an abstract type name.  The "first" part (the
abstract qualifier) is indicated as a NamedAtomicType, but must be
a TypeMetaParameter or an AbstractTemplateId.  The "rest" part is
a PossiblyQualifiedName, which is a sequence of identifiers and
template-ids (to be shown on the as-yet-nonexistent Diagram 3).

<p>
Example:
<pre>
  template &lt;class T&gt;
  struct A {
    typename T::SomeType s;
  };
</pre>
The type of A::s is <tt>T::SomeType</tt>, which is abstract because
<TT>T</TT> is.

<p>
In Elsa, this is called a "DependentQualifiedType" or "DQT".


<h2>AbstractSizedArrayType</h2>

<p>
An AbstractSizedArrayType is an ArrayType whose size is specified by
an abstract Expression.  This is a necessary concept to permit matching
declarations with definitions in some cases, for example (variant
of <a href="../in/t0435.cc">../in/t0435.cc</a>):
<pre>
  template &lt;int n&gt;
  struct A {
    int foo(int (*p)[n]);
    int foo(int (*p)[n+1]);
  };

  template &lt;int n&gt;
  int A&lt;n&gt;::foo(int (*p)[n]) { /*...*/ }

  template &lt;int n&gt;
  int A&lt;n&gt;::foo(int (*p)[n+1]) { /*...*/ }
</pre>
Here, the array size expressions must be recorded in the data model
to enable the declarations of <tt>A::foo</tt> to be matched with
their definitions.


<h2>MetaEntity Scopes</h2>

<p>
Two extensions of Scope are used for template support.

<h3>MetaParameterScope</h3>

<p>
MetaParameters are stored in a MetaParameterScope.  When this scope
is searched by lookup, MetaParameters can be found.

<h3>MetaBindingScope</h3>

<p>
When an implicit specialization is instantiated, the static semantics
require analyzing the specialization in light of its arguments.  The
arguments are bound in a MetaBindingScope for this purpose.

<p>
(At the moment I cannot justify distinguishing a MetaParameterScope from
a MetaBindingScope, but I know that Elsa needs to be able to tell them
apart somewhere, so I'm reasonably confident that they do in fact need to be
distinguished.)


<h2>AbstractEnumerator</h2>

<p>
An AbstractEnumerator is like an Enumerator, but the precise value
is unknown because its initializing expression is abstract.  It is
a refinement of the Enumerator entity presented in Diagram 1.

<p>
It is not clear whether it is adequate to simply record that its value
is abstract, as done here, or if it must actually carry the
expression.  The testcase <a href="../in/t0578.cc">../in/t0578.cc</a>
would be valid if AbstractEnumerators carried their value, and invalid
otherwise.  Both ICC and GCC reject it, so at least the data model
here is consistent their their interpretation.  If the Standard had a
clear data model, such as the one presented in these diagrams, such a
question would have a clear answer.


<h2>OutOfLineTemplateMemberDefinition (abbreviated: OOLTMDefn)</h2>

<p>
A ClassMember of a ClassTemplate may have an out-of-line definition.
If so, it has an OutOfLineTemplateMemberDefinition, which
carries a sequence of MetaParameterLists.  These parameter lists
override the nominal parameter names coming from the enclosing
template class(es).  For example, in the following syntax:
<pre>
  template &lt;class S1&gt;
  struct A {
    template &lt;class T2&gt;
    struct B {
      int f();
    };
  };

  template &lt;class S2&gt;
  template &lt;class T2&gt;
  int A&lt;S2&gt;::B&lt;T2&gt;::f() { /*...*/ }
</pre>
the ClassMember for A::B::f will have enclosing parameter lists
<tt>&lt;S2&gt;</tt> and <tt>&lt;T2&gt;</tt>.  The definition of
A::B::f may refer to the parameters in its enclosing parameter lists
(S2 and T2), but not to the parameters in the enclosing
TemplateClasses (S and T).

<p>
The order of the enclosingParams[] sequence is significant.  The first
parameter list corresponds to the outermost enclosing template class,
then proceeding towards the next innermost in sequence, until the last
parameter list corresponds to the innermost enclosing template class.
In other words, the enclosingParams[] sequence order is the same as
the order in which they appear syntactically [14.7.3p17(?)].

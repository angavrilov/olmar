The files in this directory are the compiler-supplied header
files for the Elkhound-based C++ parser.  For now they are
just what is needed to get Mozilla to parse, modified to
not use namespaces (since my parser doesn't yet handle them).

I envision the parser acquiring more functionality, at which
time more of the headers specified in the Standard will have
to be written and placed here.

The headers that are required but not supplied are, in practice,
taken from gcc's headers since I'm using gcc's "cpp" command
and it knows where to find its own compiler-specific headers.
But I'm supplying a -I pointing at this directory, so anything
here takes precedence.
